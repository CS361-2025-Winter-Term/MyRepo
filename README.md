## **About the Project**

This project is a term-long software engineering assignment focused on creating a **Personal Habit Tracking Application**. It challenges teams to use agile methodologies, collaborative tools, and object-oriented programming to design, build, and deliver a feature-rich application.

### **Key Objectives**

- Build a habit-tracking app with features like user profiles, habit tracking, gamification, and data analysis.
- Apply best practices in software development, including requirements gathering, design, and testing.
- Use GitHub for version control and Microsoft Teams for communication and collaboration.

---

## **Features**

1. **User Profile Management**: Create, edit, delete profiles with secure authentication.
2. **Habit Tracking**: Add, edit, and manage habits with customizable parameters.
3. **Reminder and Notification System**: Keep users engaged with timely reminders.
4. **Gamification**: Achievements, challenges, and leaderboards to motivate users.
5. **Data Insights**: Visualize progress using charts and heatmaps.
6. **Export/Import**: Secure data backup and migration.
7. **Cross-User Data Sharing**: Enable collaboration among users within the app.

## **Getting Started**

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   # Example for a Python-based app:
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Explore the Project Structure**

   - `src/`: Source code for the application.
   - `cp_assignments/`: Course Projects Assignements.
   - `docs/`: Documentation, including UML diagrams and project notes.
   - `tests/`: Unit and integration test cases.
   - `assets/`: Media assets like images, videos.

## **Collaboration Instructions**

### Communication:
- Use the designated Microsoft Teams channel for discussions, questions, and updates.
- Check GitHub Issues for task assignments and progress tracking.

### Version Control:
- Use the GitHub repository linked to this project for source code management.

### Task Management:
- Refer to the GitHub Project board for task assignments, status updates, and deadlines.
- Update task status as you work (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Completed").

### Documentation:
- Maintain clear and organized documentation for your work (e.g., code comments, UML diagrams).
- Update the Wiki for project-related instructions and findings.

## **Project Workflow**

This project follows an agile methodology using GitHub for task management and collaboration.

1. **Branches:**
   - `main`: Stable, production-ready code.
   - `develop`: Integrated development branch.
   - `feature/xyz`: Feature-specific branches.

2. **GitHub Project Board:**
   - Tasks are managed on a **Kanban board** with columns: `To Do`, `In Progress`, `Review`, and `Done`.

3. **Pull Requests:**
   - Always open a pull request for code review.
   - Link pull requests to their corresponding GitHub issues.
